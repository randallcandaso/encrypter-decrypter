Encrypter: This program asks the user to input a file and in return the program
will encrypt that file. It will encrypt it by randomizing its order,
of text, along with creating a index file to serve as a key.

Decrypter: This program asks the user to input an already encrypted file
along with its index file. Then, the program will take the
encrypted file and reorganize it back to its original order
based on the index file.
